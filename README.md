# MS-DOS 6.22 and Windows98 disk defrag simulator

Grab a drink and idle behind a smoothing experience of a DOS or Win98 disk defragmentation.

You can choose having a more relaxing defrag experience with oldschool HDD sounds based on hdd's speed : between 1 or 8 IOPS ! 

You can choose a full console experience or a graphical Win98 (Win95 coming soon).
